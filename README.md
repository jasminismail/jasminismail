I am currently pursuing my part-time studies for a Specialist Diploma in Cybersecurity with a strong interest in cybersecurity and a dedication to safeguarding the digital world.

## Objective

I have obtained a ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) 24' which has led me to develop a strong foundation in cybersecurity, and I am eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
